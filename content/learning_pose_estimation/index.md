title: Learning Pose Estimation for UAV Autonomous Navigation and Landing Using Visual-Inertial Sensor Data
summary: A new learning approach for autonomous navigation and landing of an Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV).
We develop a multimodal fusion of deep neural architectures for visual-inertial odometry, and we train the model in an end-to-end fashion to estimate the current vehicle pose from streams of visual and inertial measurements.
